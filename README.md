# Quiz

This project is a quiz application with Flutter & Dart.

There are 6 questions with each 4 possible answers. The answers are always shuffled randomly.
At the end of the quiz the application will show a summary of the questions with the correct solution and the selected answer. Also your score will be displayed.

In this project I learned the difference between the use of Statelesswidget and Statefullwidget. 
Furthermore, I learned how to display icons. 
The end solution summary makes use of the SingleChildScrollView widget which makes the list scrollable when it exceeds the height limits.
The questions and answers are stored in a data model and are accessed through a QuizQuestion model, which is the blueprint for the questions.
