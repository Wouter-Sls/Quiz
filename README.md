# Quiz

This project is a quiz application with Flutter & Dart.

There are 6 questions with each 4 possible answers. The answers are always shuffled randomly.
At the end of the quiz the application will show a summary of the questions with the correct solution and the selected answer. Also your score will be displayed.

In this project I learned the difference between the use of Statelesswidget and Statefullwidget. 
Furthermore, I learned how to display icons.
The questions and answers are stored in a data model and are accessed through a QuizQuestion model, which is the blueprint for the questions.
